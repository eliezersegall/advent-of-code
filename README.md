About AoC

What is AoC?
Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar for programmers, where each day of December you are provided with a new problem to solve with a language of your choice. Each year has a fantastic plot and story line you can follow along with as you solve each days challenge.

Who makes Advent of Code?
Each year Eric Wastl and a small team go about creating an event that is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts around the globe. You can find out more about it on the AoC Website

What is ZTM's involvement?
Whilst AoC provide an official leaderboard, we thought it would be awesome to have a collection hub and leaderboard for all solutions created by members of the Zero To Mastery community. A central location where you can view solutions from other members, add your own solutions, give some love to your favourite solutions and of course see how you rank against other members of the community.

Can I join in?
Everyone is encouraged to participate, it's a fantastic opportunity to learn, practice and expand your knowledge and skill set. It's also a huge amount of fun.

What languages can I use?
You are free to use whichever language you feel would be best suited to the problem at hand. You are also welcome to submit multiple solutions in different languages.


The Project

The Aim

The aim of this project was to redevelop and build upon last years version of this website, which was embedded into the old Zero To Mastery website, which you can find here.

The Frontend
For this project we decided to use a React front end and Material-UI. Using Material-UI allowed us to concentrate on building the app out, when time was limited, rather than focusing on the building out brand new component styling.

The Backend
Due to the functions we needed the Backend to perform, we decided to run the backend from a Discord bot utilizing Discord.js and Mongo. This essentially provided us with more control over how and when we could post automatic updates to the Discord server, whilst also ensuring solutions were legitimate ZTM member solutions.

The Team
A small team made up of fellow students from the Star Mentors and Management Team (some of which are listed above), spent the month of November planning, discussing and building out this web application.

The Repo & Bug/Feature Reporting
If you would like to take a look at the code, you can find the github repository here. Please feel free to create issues for bug tracking and feature requests. Although it is unlikely that new features will be added whilst the event is live, however they will most definitely be considered next year.
